// NB NB NB NB NB Some Notes on Deployment NB NB NB NB NB

// Deployment is a bit beyond the scope of this article, but if you want
// to take your recipe search live, you need to be careful. Elasticsearch
// has no concept of users or permissions. If you want to prevent just
// anyone from adding or deleting recipes, youâ€™ll need to find some way
// to prevent access to those REST endpoints on your Elasticsearch
// instance. For example, OpenRecipeSearch.com uses nginx as a proxy in
// front of Elasticsearch to prevent outside access to all endpoints but
// recipes/recipe/_search.
